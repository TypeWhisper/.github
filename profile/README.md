## What is TypeWhisper?

TypeWhisper is a free, open-source speech-to-text app that runs entirely on your device. Press a hotkey, speak, and the transcription is pasted into whatever app you're using - no cloud round-trip required.

### Highlights

- **100% on-device** - All AI processing happens locally. No telemetry, no data collection, no network requests during transcription.
- **Multiple speech engines** - Choose between WhisperKit (99+ languages), Parakeet TDT (fast European-language model), Apple Speech (macOS), and ONNX-based engines (Windows).
- **System-wide dictation** - Global hotkey with push-to-talk, toggle, or hybrid mode. Works in any app.
- **Per-app profiles** - Automatically switch language, engine, and post-processing based on the active app or website.
- **File transcription** - Drag and drop audio/video files, export subtitles as SRT or WebVTT.
- **Local HTTP API** - Integrate with scripts, shortcuts, and automation tools.
- **Plugin system** - Extend with cloud providers (Groq, OpenAI, Gemini), actions (Linear, Webhooks), and custom add-ons.
- **Dictionary and snippets** - Custom terms, corrections, and text expansions with dynamic placeholders.
